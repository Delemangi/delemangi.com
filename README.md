# Delemangi

This is my personal homepage, which can be found [here](https://delemangi.com). It uses React and Material UI.

## Quick Setup

1. Install Docker
2. Grab the `compose.prod.yaml` file from the repository
3. Run `docker compose -f compose.prod.yaml up -d`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:Delemangi/delemangi.com.git` (or `https://github.com/Delemangi/delemangi.com.git`)
2. Install dependencies: `npm i`

## Running

You can either run `npm run dev` to start a development server, or `npm run build` and `npm run preview` to build and deploy a server running the application, or check the quick setup from above to run it inside Docker painlessly.
